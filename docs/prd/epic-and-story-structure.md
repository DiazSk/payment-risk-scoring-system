# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic for brownfield enhancement with rationale: This enhancement addresses interconnected concerns (fake metrics, AML compliance, velocity checking) that share common infrastructure and model training components. A single epic ensures coordinated implementation and maintains system integrity throughout the transformation.

## Epic 1: Payment Risk Scoring System Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: Transform the existing fraud detection system from artificial metrics to a professional, honest payment risk scoring platform with real AML and velocity checking capabilities while maintaining architectural sophistication and free-tier deployment.

**Integration Requirements**: All new features must integrate seamlessly with existing FastAPI/Streamlit architecture, maintain sub-150ms response times, and preserve backward compatibility for current API consumers.

### Story 1.1: Remove Artificial Metrics and Implement Realistic Model Training

As a **technical professional**,  
I want **the system to display honest, realistic performance metrics (87% accuracy)**,  
so that **I can confidently defend the system's capabilities in interviews and professional contexts**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace all hardcoded perfect scores (1.000) in model training pipeline with realistic evaluation methods
2. Retrain models to achieve target 87% accuracy with balanced precision/recall trade-offs
3. Update all performance reports and dashboard displays to show honest metrics
4. Ensure new metrics are mathematically sound and auditable
5. Remove all references to 92.3% fraud detection rate claims from documentation and code

#### Integration Verification
**IV1**: Existing FastAPI endpoints continue to function with new model artifacts without API contract changes  
**IV2**: Streamlit dashboard displays updated metrics without breaking existing visualization components  
**IV3**: Response times remain under current 89ms baseline with new realistic models

### Story 1.2: Implement AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Compliance Features

As a **compliance officer or financial analyst**,  
I want **real-time AML checking capabilities for suspicious transaction patterns**,  
so that **the system meets industry regulatory requirements and detects money laundering risks**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create new `/aml_check` endpoint with transaction pattern analysis
2. Implement suspicious activity detection for rapid transfers, unusual amounts, and high-risk merchant categories
3. Add configurable AML threshold monitoring with regulatory compliance logging
4. Create AML dashboard tab with real-time monitoring and alert capabilities
5. Implement basic watchlist screening functionality for high-risk entities

#### Integration Verification
**IV1**: New AML features integrate with existing transaction processing pipeline without data format changes  
**IV2**: AML dashboard tab follows existing Streamlit component patterns and styling  
**IV3**: AML processing adds less than 30ms to overall transaction analysis time

### Story 1.3: Add Transaction Velocity Checking and Risk Scoring

As a **fraud analyst**,  
I want **velocity-based fraud detection with configurable time windows**,  
so that **I can identify rapid-fire transaction patterns that indicate compromised accounts**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement velocity checking across multiple time windows (1 hour, 24 hour, 7 day)
2. Create `/velocity_analysis` endpoint for real-time velocity risk assessment
3. Add velocity-based features to existing ML model pipeline
4. Develop velocity monitoring dashboard with historical pattern analysis
5. Implement configurable velocity thresholds with automated risk scoring

#### Integration Verification
**IV1**: Velocity features enhance existing 82-feature engineering pipeline without breaking current feature calculations  
**IV2**: Velocity dashboard integrates with existing monitoring infrastructure and styling patterns  
**IV3**: Velocity analysis completes within existing sub-100ms response time requirements

### Story 1.4: Create AWS-Ready Architecture Documentation

As a **DevOps engineer or technical interviewer**,  
I want **comprehensive AWS deployment architecture documentation**,  
so that **the system demonstrates enterprise-ready scalability and professional infrastructure design**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create detailed AWS infrastructure-as-code templates (CloudFormation/Terraform)
2. Document scalable architecture for AWS ECS/Lambda deployment options
3. Design cost-optimized AWS architecture suitable for production scaling
4. Create migration guide from Railway to AWS with minimal downtime
5. Document AWS security best practices for financial data processing

#### Integration Verification
**IV1**: AWS architecture documentation accurately reflects current Railway deployment patterns and requirements  
**IV2**: Proposed AWS infrastructure supports existing Docker containerization without application code changes  
**IV3**: AWS cost estimates demonstrate viable scaling path from current free-tier deployment

### Story 1.5: Enhanced Testing and Documentation for Professional Portfolio

As a **potential employer or technical reviewer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing coverage and professional documentation**,  
so that **I can verify the system's quality and the developer's professional capabilities**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend test suite to cover all new AML and velocity features with 100% coverage
2. Create professional README with honest metrics, feature descriptions, and deployment guides
3. Update API documentation with new endpoints and realistic performance benchmarks
4. Create technical blog post or documentation explaining the transformation from fake to real metrics
5. Add comprehensive error handling and logging for all new features

#### Integration Verification
**IV1**: Enhanced test suite maintains existing 15/15 passing tests while adding comprehensive coverage for new features  
**IV2**: Updated documentation accurately reflects actual system capabilities without breaking existing doc structure  
**IV3**: New logging and error handling follows existing patterns and doesn't impact system performance
