# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis

**Current Project State**: 
A fully deployed credit card fraud detection system on Railway Cloud with FastAPI backend, Streamlit dashboard, and 4 ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest). The system currently claims 92.3% fraud detection rate with 1.3% false positive rate but shows artificial perfect scores (1.000) across all metrics in training reports.

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation - Found in ARCHITECTURE.md and code structure
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture - Comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md with microservices flow
- ✅ API Documentation - FastAPI auto-generated docs at /docs endpoint
- ❌ Coding Standards - Not explicitly documented
- ✅ External API Documentation - Railway deployment docs
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines - No formal design system documented
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation - Critical gap: no documentation of the fake metrics issue
- ✅ Other: Performance benchmarks (though containing fake data)

**Critical Finding**: System has good technical documentation but lacks documentation of the core technical debt - the artificial metrics system that needs replacement.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**:
- ✅ Major Feature Modification - Transform fake metrics to realistic ones
- ✅ New Feature Addition - Add AML checks and velocity checking
- ✅ Performance/Scalability Improvements - AWS-ready architecture
- ✅ Technology Stack Upgrade - Enhanced fintech capabilities
- ✅ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements - Fix the core metrics integrity issue

**Enhancement Description**: 
Transform the existing credit card fraud detection system from displaying artificial perfect metrics (92.3% fraud detection rate) into an honest, professional payment risk scoring system with realistic performance (87% accuracy) while adding real-world fintech features including AML compliance checks and transaction velocity monitoring.

**Impact Assessment**: 
- ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Remove all artificial/fake metrics and replace with honest, defendable performance numbers
- Implement real AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance checking features
- Add transaction velocity monitoring and risk scoring
- Create AWS-ready deployment architecture documentation
- Maintain free-tier deployment capability on platforms like Render/Railway
- Ensure all metrics and features can be defended in technical interviews
- Transform reputation risk into professional portfolio piece

**Background Context**:
The current fraud detection system was built with artificially inflated metrics that create professional reputation risk. Training reports showing perfect 1.000 scores across all metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) are clearly unrealistic and would be immediately questioned by any technical interviewer or potential employer. 

This enhancement transforms the system into a legitimate, professional-grade payment risk scoring platform that incorporates real fintech industry standards. The goal is to maintain the sophisticated technical architecture while ensuring all performance claims are honest, realistic, and defensible. The addition of AML and velocity checking brings the system in line with actual financial industry requirements.
