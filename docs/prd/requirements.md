# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall replace all artificial metrics (92.3% fraud detection rate, 1.000 perfect scores) with realistic performance metrics targeting 87% accuracy with appropriate precision/recall trade-offs

**FR2**: The system shall implement real-time AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance checking including suspicious transaction pattern detection, watchlist screening, and regulatory threshold monitoring

**FR3**: The system shall add transaction velocity checking with configurable time windows (1 hour, 24 hour, 7 day) to detect rapid-fire transaction patterns indicative of fraud

**FR4**: The existing FastAPI backend shall be enhanced to support new AML and velocity checking endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility with current prediction endpoints

**FR5**: The system shall implement realistic fraud detection algorithms that can achieve and maintain the claimed 87% accuracy in production environments

**FR6**: All performance reporting and dashboard metrics shall display honest, verifiable results that can be defended in technical interviews

**FR7**: The system shall maintain existing real-time processing capabilities (sub-200ms response times) while adding new AML and velocity features

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing FastAPI architecture and Railway deployment compatibility without exceeding free tier limits

**NFR2**: New AML and velocity features must not increase average API response time beyond 150ms (currently 89ms baseline)

**NFR3**: System must maintain 99.5% uptime during the enhancement implementation with zero-downtime deployment strategy

**NFR4**: All new metrics calculation methods must be transparent, auditable, and based on real mathematical models rather than hardcoded values

**NFR5**: Enhanced system must be AWS-deployment ready with documented infrastructure-as-code templates while maintaining current Railway deployment

**NFR6**: Memory usage must not exceed 500MB per instance to remain within free tier constraints across platforms

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: API Compatibility - All existing `/predict` and `/batch_predict` endpoints must remain fully functional with current request/response schemas

**CR2**: Database Schema Compatibility - Current pickle model storage and JSON metadata structure must be maintained while adding new model artifacts for AML/velocity features

**CR3**: UI/UX Consistency - Streamlit dashboard must integrate new AML and velocity monitoring without breaking existing fraud detection displays

**CR4**: Integration Compatibility - Current Railway deployment pipeline and health check endpoints must remain operational throughout enhancement
