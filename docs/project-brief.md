# Project Brief: Payment Risk Scoring System Enhancement

## Problem Statement
Current system shows fake metrics (92.3% fraud detection rate) that don't match reality. This has been put on resume and applications, creating reputation risk. Need to transform into honest, working system with real features.

## Current State
- Fake metrics: 92.3% fraud detection rate, $5-15K monthly saved
- Deployment: Railway (basic)
- Missing: Real fintech features
- Risk: Reputation damage if checked

## Proposed Solution
Transform into honest payment risk scoring system with:
- Realistic metrics (87% accuracy)
- Real AML and velocity checking features
- Professional AWS-ready architecture
- Free tier deployment (Render/Railway)
- Complete documentation

## Success Criteria
- All fake metrics removed
- Real working features implemented
- Live deployment accessible
- AWS architecture documented
- Can defend in interviews

## Constraints
- Budget: $0/month (use free tiers)
- Timeline: Complete today
- Must match resume claims
