# Story 1.4 — Create AWS-Ready Deployment Architecture Documentation

**Background & Context:**
The current deployment is optimized for Railway Cloud and free-tier platforms, but lacks comprehensive documentation for AWS deployment. Professional-grade fintech systems require robust, scalable, and secure cloud architecture, and AWS is a standard in the industry.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create detailed documentation for deploying the system on AWS, including architecture diagrams and step-by-step instructions.
2. Cover key AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch) relevant to the system.
3. Include infrastructure-as-code examples (Terraform, CloudFormation) for reproducible deployments.
4. Document security, scalability, and cost optimization best practices.
5. Ensure documentation is clear, actionable, and suitable for technical interviews or portfolio review.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Review existing architecture and adapt for AWS best practices.
- Create diagrams showing service integration and data flow.
- Provide sample configuration files and scripts for AWS deployment.
- Document migration steps from Railway/Render to AWS.
- Highlight differences and trade-offs between platforms.

**Dependencies:**
- PRD: docs/prd/intro-project-analysis-and-context.md
- Architecture docs: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/brownfield-architecture/
- Deployment docs: docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, deployment/terraform/, deployment/kubernetes/

**Risks:**
- AWS costs may exceed free-tier limits if not optimized.
- Complexity of AWS services may require additional learning for users.

**Definition of Done:**
- AWS deployment documentation created and reviewed.
- Architecture diagrams and sample configs included.
- Security and scalability considerations documented.
- Documentation validated for clarity and completeness.

## Tasks
- [x] Create comprehensive AWS deployment guide with architecture documentation
- [x] Develop Terraform infrastructure-as-code for complete AWS deployment  
- [x] Create CloudFormation templates as alternative infrastructure option
- [x] Document security configurations, best practices, and cost optimization
- [x] Provide deployment scripts and automation tools

## Dev Agent Record

**Agent Model Used:** GitHub Copilot (GPT-4)

**Status:** Ready for Review

### Completion Notes
-  Created comprehensive AWS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with complete architecture documentation
-  Developed complete Terraform infrastructure with main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
-  Created CloudFormation alternative with fraud-detection-stack.yaml template
-  Provided deployment automation with both Bash and PowerShell scripts
-  Documented security best practices, cost optimization, and monitoring setup
-  Included detailed troubleshooting and post-deployment configuration guides

### File List
- docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (comprehensive AWS architecture documentation)
- deployment/terraform/main.tf (complete Terraform infrastructure)
- deployment/terraform/variables.tf (Terraform variable definitions)
- deployment/terraform/outputs.tf (Terraform output configurations)
- deployment/terraform/terraform.tfvars.example (example configuration)
- deployment/cloudformation/fraud-detection-stack.yaml (CloudFormation template)
- deployment/cloudformation/parameters.env (CloudFormation parameters)
- deployment/cloudformation/deploy.sh (Bash deployment script)
- deployment/cloudformation/deploy.ps1 (PowerShell deployment script) 
- deployment/cloudformation/README.md (CloudFormation deployment guide)

### Change Log
- Created comprehensive AWS deployment architecture documentation
- Implemented production-ready Terraform infrastructure-as-code
- Added CloudFormation templates as alternative deployment option
- Included security configurations and best practices
- Provided automated deployment scripts for both platforms

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 7, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent AWS architecture documentation with comprehensive infrastructure-as-code implementation. The documentation demonstrates professional understanding of cloud deployment best practices with complete Terraform and CloudFormation templates. Security considerations and automation scripts show production-ready approach.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - documentation and infrastructure code meet professional standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Infrastructure code follows best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized deployment documentation and templates
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Deployment validation through infrastructure-as-code
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully addressed with comprehensive coverage

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Comprehensive AWS deployment guide with architecture diagrams
[x] Complete Terraform infrastructure with variables and outputs
[x] CloudFormation templates as alternative deployment option
[x] Security best practices and cost optimization documentation
[x] Automated deployment scripts for multiple platforms

### Security Review

✅ PASS - Security best practices documented including IAM roles, VPC configuration, and monitoring setup. Infrastructure-as-code ensures consistent security configurations.

### Performance Considerations

✅ PASS - Scalable architecture with auto-scaling and load balancing considerations. Performance optimization strategies documented.

### Files Modified During Review

None - documentation and infrastructure quality meets production standards.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-aws-ready-architecture-docs.yml
Risk profile: LOW - Infrastructure-as-code ensures consistency
NFR assessment: All requirements met with comprehensive documentation

### Recommended Status

✅ Ready for Done - Professional infrastructure documentation ready for production deployment
