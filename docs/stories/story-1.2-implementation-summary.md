- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Edge case validation and error handling tests
- All tests passing (21/21 total system tests)

### Technical Implementation Details

#### AML Risk Assessment Components

1. **Structuring Detection**
   - CTR threshold monitoring ($10,000)
   - 24-hour window analysis for multiple transactions
   - Pattern recognition for threshold avoidance

2. **Rapid Movement Analysis**
   - Large transaction flagging (>$50,000)
   - Velocity analysis within 6-hour windows
   - Round amount detection (money laundering indicators)

3. **Suspicious Pattern Detection**
   - Unusual timing analysis (off-hours transactions)
   - High-risk merchant category screening
   - Geographic risk assessment
   - Repeated digit pattern detection

4. **Sanctions Screening**
   - Real-time name matching against sanctions lists
   - Geographic sanctions checking
   - Configurable sanctions database integration

#### Risk Scoring Algorithm

- **Weighted Scoring**: Suspicious patterns (35%), Sanctions (25%), Structuring (20%), Rapid Movement (20%)
- **Risk Levels**: MINIMAL (0-0.19), LOW (0.2-0.34), MEDIUM (0.35-0.59), HIGH (0.6+)
- **Manual Review Thresholds**: Automatic flagging for scores ≥0.7 or sanctions matches

### API Enhancements

#### Enhanced Fraud Prediction Response
```json
{
    "is_fraud": true,
    "fraud_probability": 0.75,
    "aml_risk_score": 0.65,
    "combined_risk_score": 0.72,
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "aml_risk_level": "MEDIUM",
    "aml_flags": ["LARGE_SINGLE_TRANSACTION", "UNUSUAL_TIMING"],
    "requires_manual_review": true
}
```

#### Dedicated AML Assessment Endpoint
- Standalone AML compliance checking
- Detailed component risk scores
- Compliance recommendations
- Audit trail with timestamps

### Dashboard Features

- **Interactive AML Testing**: Live transaction assessment tools
- **Risk Analytics**: Visual distribution of AML risk levels
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical AML flag patterns
- **Configuration Management**: View and understand current AML settings
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate daily/weekly compliance reports

### Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

- Framework designed for regulatory compliance (requires professional review)
- Configurable rules to adapt to changing regulations
- Comprehensive audit logging for all AML assessments
- Data retention considerations documented
- Integration points for official sanctions databases

### Performance Impact

- AML checks add minimal latency (<50ms per transaction)
- Feature engineering includes AML features automatically
- Graceful degradation if AML module unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Future Enhancement Roadmap

1. **Real-time Sanctions Integration**: Connect to live OFAC databases
2. **PEP Database Integration**: Politically Exposed Persons screening
3. **ML-based Pattern Recognition**: Advanced anomaly detection
4. **Automated SAR Generation**: Enhanced suspicious activity reporting
5. **Geographic Risk Scoring**: Advanced country/region assessment
