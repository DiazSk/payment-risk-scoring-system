# Story 1.7 — Transform Reputation Risk into Professional Portfolio Piece

**Background & Context:**
The system’s history of artificial metrics and missing compliance features created reputation risk. With enhancements, the platform should be positioned as a professional, portfolio-ready solution that demonstrates industry best practices and technical rigor.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Update all documentation to highlight the transformation from artificial metrics to honest, industry-standard risk scoring.
2. Showcase AML and velocity monitoring features as differentiators.
3. Provide a summary of technical challenges overcome and lessons learned.
4. Create a portfolio/demo guide for interviews and presentations.
5. Ensure all code, documentation, and reports reflect the system’s professional status.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add before/after comparison in documentation to illustrate improvements.
- Highlight compliance, scalability, and defensibility features.
- Prepare demo scripts and talking points for portfolio use.
- Refactor README and project brief to emphasize professional value.

**Dependencies:**
- PRD: docs/prd/intro-project-analysis-and-context.md
- Documentation: docs/project-brief.md, docs/README.md, docs/PERFORMANCE.md

**Risks:**
- Overstating improvements may undermine credibility.
- Portfolio guide must be concise and focused for interviews.

**Definition of Done:**
- Documentation and demo materials updated to showcase professional transformation.
- Portfolio guide created and validated.
