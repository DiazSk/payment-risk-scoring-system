# Story 1.3 — Add Transaction Velocity Monitoring and Risk Scoring

**Background & Context:**
The current system does not monitor transaction velocity, which is a key indicator of potential fraud and risk in payment systems. Velocity monitoring tracks the frequency and volume of transactions over time to detect abnormal patterns, such as rapid-fire purchases or withdrawals, which may signal fraudulent activity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Design and implement transaction velocity monitoring logic in the data pipeline.
2. Define velocity-based risk scoring rules (e.g., thresholds for number/amount of transactions per time window).
3. Integrate velocity features into model training and prediction.
4. Update API and dashboard to display velocity risk scores and relevant alerts.
5. Document velocity monitoring logic and configuration options.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add feature engineering for transaction velocity (e.g., transactions per minute/hour/day).
- Update model inputs to include velocity features.
- Refactor dashboard and API outputs to show velocity risk scores and alerts.
- Ensure velocity thresholds are configurable.
- Document the rationale and configuration for velocity monitoring.

**Dependencies:**
- PRD: docs/prd/intro-project-analysis-and-context.md
- Data pipeline: src/data_pipeline.py, src/feature_engineering.py
- Model training: src/model_training.py
- Dashboard: dashboard/app.py, dashboard/components.py
- API: app/main.py, app/predictor.py

**Risks:**
- Incorrect velocity thresholds may lead to false positives or missed fraud.
- May require tuning based on real transaction data.

**Definition of Done:**
- Transaction velocity monitoring logic implemented and integrated.
- Velocity risk scores and alerts displayed in API and dashboard.
- Documentation updated to explain velocity monitoring features.
- Code reviewed and validated for completeness.
