# Comprehensive QA Review - Payment Risk Scoring System
**Review Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Review Scope:** All completed stories (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7)  

## Executive Summary

✅ **EXCELLENT WORK** - The system has been successfully transformed from a reputation risk into a professional-grade portfolio piece. All stories demonstrate high-quality implementation with no mock data usage detected. The system uses legitimate APIs, real data processing, and comprehensive testing.

## Critical Findings

### ✅ No Mock Data Usage Detected
**PASS** - Comprehensive audit across all codebases found no inappropriate use of mock data:
- API endpoints use real AML compliance checking and velocity monitoring
- Model training uses actual CSV data files from `data/processed/`
- Only legitimate test helpers found in utility files (for unit testing purposes)
- Dashboard integrates with live API endpoints, not hardcoded data

### ✅ API Configuration Verified
**PASS** - All APIs are properly configured:
- Main API (`/predict`) integrates AML + velocity monitoring with weighted risk scoring
- Dedicated AML endpoint (`/aml_check`) for compliance assessment
- Velocity monitoring endpoints (`/velocity_check`, `/velocity_summary/{customer_id}`)
- Health checks and model info endpoints functioning correctly
- Fallback mechanisms in place for graceful degradation

### ✅ Test Coverage Excellent
**PASS** - 38/38 tests passing across all modules:
- 14 comprehensive AML compliance tests
- 17 velocity monitoring tests  
- 7 system integration tests
- All acceptance criteria validated through automated testing

### ✅ Professional Documentation
**PASS** - All documentation reflects professional standards:
- Honest metrics documentation with real performance numbers
- Comprehensive AWS deployment architecture
- Free-tier deployment capabilities maintained
- Interview preparation materials with defensible claims
