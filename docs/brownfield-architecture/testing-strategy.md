# Testing Strategy

### Integration with Existing Tests

**Existing Test Framework:** pytest with organized test modules, descriptive test naming conventions, comprehensive pipeline testing approach

**Test Organization:** Maintain existing `tests/` directory structure with separate modules for different components (`test_api.py` for endpoint testing, `test_complete_pipeline.py` for integration testing)

**Coverage Requirements:** Preserve existing 100% coverage target while extending to new AML and velocity features, maintain current 15/15 passing baseline and expand systematically

### New Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests for New Components

**Framework:** pytest (maintaining consistency with existing test infrastructure)
**Location:** `tests/test_aml_engine.py`, `tests/test_velocity_checker.py`, `tests/test_realistic_metrics.py`
**Coverage Target:** 100% coverage for all new modules, including edge cases and error conditions
**Integration with Existing:** New unit tests must not break existing test execution, follow same naming and organization patterns

#### Integration Tests

**Scope:** End-to-end testing of fraud detection + AML + velocity analysis workflows, API endpoint integration testing, dashboard functionality validation

**Existing System Verification:** 
- All current `/predict` and `/batch_predict` endpoints continue to function identically
- Existing model loading and prediction logic remains unchanged
- Current dashboard pages display correctly with new features disabled
- Performance benchmarks maintained (sub-150ms response times)

**New Feature Testing:**
- AML compliance analysis produces consistent, defendable results
- Velocity checking accurately calculates risk across multiple time windows
- Realistic metrics generation produces mathematically sound performance measurements
- Combined risk scoring integrates all components logically

#### Regression Testing

**Existing Feature Verification:** 
- Automated regression suite covering all 15 existing tests plus new comprehensive scenarios
- Performance regression testing to ensure new features don't impact existing response times
- Model prediction consistency testing to verify existing fraud detection accuracy preserved

**Automated Regression Suite:**
```python
# Example test structure
class TestRegressionSuite:
    def test_existing_api_unchanged(self):
        """Verify existing API contracts remain identical"""
        
    def test_model_predictions_consistent(self):
        """Ensure existing model outputs unchanged"""
        
    def test_performance_benchmarks_maintained(self):
        """Verify response times within existing limits"""
```

**Manual Testing Requirements:**
- Dashboard visual regression testing for existing fraud detection pages
- Railway deployment testing with new model artifacts
- Memory usage validation within Railway free tier limits
- AWS deployment documentation validation
