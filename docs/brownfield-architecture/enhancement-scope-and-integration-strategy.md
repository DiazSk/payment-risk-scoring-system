# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

### Enhancement Overview
- **Enhancement Type:** Major Feature Modification + New Feature Addition
- **Scope:** Transform artificial metrics system to realistic performance while adding AML compliance and velocity checking
- **Integration Impact:** Moderate - extends existing 82-feature pipeline and adds new API endpoints while preserving current architecture

### Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** Extend existing FastAPI router pattern with new endpoints (`/aml_check`, `/velocity_analysis`) while maintaining current prediction endpoints for backward compatibility

**Database Integration:** Enhance existing pickle/JSON storage pattern with new model artifacts for AML and velocity features, preserving current model metadata structure

**API Integration:** Add new REST endpoints following existing FastAPI patterns, maintaining same authentication, middleware, and error handling approaches

**UI Integration:** Extend Streamlit dashboard with new tabs for AML monitoring and velocity analysis, following existing component architecture in `components.py`

### Compatibility Requirements
- **Existing API Compatibility:** All current `/predict` and `/batch_predict` endpoints remain unchanged with identical request/response schemas
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** Current pickle model storage and JSON metadata structure maintained while adding new AML/velocity model artifacts
- **UI/UX Consistency:** New Streamlit tabs follow existing styling patterns and component library architecture
- **Performance Impact:** New features must not exceed 150ms response time (current baseline: 89ms) and stay within 500MB memory limit for Railway free tier
