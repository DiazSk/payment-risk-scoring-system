### New Technology Additions

No new core technologies required! All enhancements can be implemented using the existing stack:

- **AML Features**: Implemented using existing pandas/NumPy for transaction pattern analysis
- **Velocity Checking**: Built with existing time-series capabilities in pandas
- **Realistic Metrics**: Achieved through enhanced scikit-learn model training
- **AWS Documentation**: Infrastructure-as-code using existing Docker patterns
