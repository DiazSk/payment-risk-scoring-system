# Security Integration

### Existing Security Measures

**Authentication:** Currently open endpoints for demonstration purposes (typical for portfolio projects), but FastAPI infrastructure ready for authentication middleware integration

**Authorization:** Role-based access can be implemented using FastAPI dependencies, current architecture supports JWT token validation patterns

**Data Protection:** 
- Transaction data handled in-memory during processing (no persistent storage of sensitive data)
- Model artifacts stored as pickle files (industry standard for ML deployments)
- Environment variables for configuration (Railway secure environment management)

**Security Tools:** 
- FastAPI built-in security features (CORS middleware, trusted host middleware)
- Docker containerization providing isolation
- Railway platform security (HTTPS termination, DDoS protection)

### Enhancement Security Requirements

**New Security Measures:**
- **AML Audit Logging:** Enhanced logging for compliance events with tamper-evident timestamps
- **Velocity Rate Limiting:** Built-in protection against rapid-fire testing of fraud detection system
- **Input Validation:** Enhanced Pydantic models with strict validation for financial data fields
- **Data Sanitization:** PII scrubbing for AML analysis logging while maintaining compliance audit trails

**Integration Points:**
- AML compliance checks integrate with existing FastAPI security middleware
- Velocity monitoring includes built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Enhanced monitoring logs security events through existing `app/monitoring.py` infrastructure

**Compliance Requirements:**
- **Financial Data Protection:** PCI DSS considerations for transaction data handling
- **AML Compliance Logging:** Regulatory audit trail requirements for suspicious activity reporting
- **Data Retention:** Configurable retention policies for compliance and velocity analysis data

### Security Testing

**Existing Security Tests:** Basic API endpoint testing in current test suite
**New Security Test Requirements:**
- **Input Validation Testing:** Comprehensive validation of AML and velocity endpoints against malicious inputs
- **Rate Limiting Testing:** Verification that velocity monitoring prevents abuse scenarios
- **Audit Trail Testing:** Validation that AML compliance events are properly logged and tamper-evident

**Penetration Testing:**
- **API Security Testing:** Automated testing of new endpoints for common vulnerabilities
- **Data Injection Testing:** Validation that enhanced Pydantic models prevent SQL injection and XSS
- **Performance-based Security Testing:** Ensure new features don't create DoS vulnerabilities
